      School rules and regulations are a set of guidelines and policies established by educational institutions to create a safe, orderly, and conducive learning environment for students. These rules are designed to maintain discipline, promote academic excellence, ensure student welfare, and foster a positive school community. While specific rules may vary between schools, here are some common areas covered by school rules and regulations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
       <b>Attendance:</b><br>  
        Schools typically have policies regarding regular attendance, including guidelines for reporting absences and procedures for makeup work.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Dress code:</b><br>
         Many schools have dress codes that outline acceptable attire, grooming standards, and restrictions on clothing that may be distracting or offensive.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Academic expectations:</b><br>
        Schools establish rules related to academic performance, such as requirements for homework completion, plagiarism policies, grading criteria, and guidelines for academic integrity.

      It's important for students and parents to familiarize themselves with the specific rules and regulations of their respective schools.
